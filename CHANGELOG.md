# Changelog

## [0.17.1] - 2026-09-09

### Page translation
- Added an opt-in per-Task **Page Translation** setting with target-language selection. Agent and headful browser runs now load translate.js for enabled Tasks, translate the initial page, and reapply translation after navigation. Translation remains off by default; Scrape mode keeps its HTTP-only behavior.

### Task execution and editor
- Added the On Execution configuration panel to new Tasks by default, with a zero-second default wait.
- Added a Task Variables shortcut in the editor header and made the editor, execution-detail, and browser-page titles contextual to the active Task or page.
- Prevented unsolicited headful popups from stealing focus, refined editor action controls, and corrected Cabinet-route sidebar highlighting.
- Normalized app typography to normal casing for improved readability.

### Storage, deployment, and verification
- Persisted Cabinet metadata across both JSON and PostgreSQL storage backends, with qualification coverage for Cabinet uploads and persistence.
- Hardened Docker publishing against Playwright runtime-version drift.
- Migrated the selected UI, user-journey, and star-prompt verification scripts to TypeScript and updated CI to run the migrated suite.

### Documentation and maintenance
- Updated README product, roadmap, and security guidance; completed the translate.js roadmap item and documented the Task translation field in `AGENT_SPEC.md`.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-09-05

### Cabinets and uploads
- Added installation-wide **Cabinets** as durable download queues, including a default Basic Cabinet, legacy-download migration, isolated item storage, upload status, Cabinet item downloads, ZIP creation, and safe archive extraction.
- Added the Cabinets workspace and Cabinet API for creation, renaming, clearing, status changes, bulk deletion, migration/deletion, downloads, ZIP, and unzip operations.
- Added per-Task download Cabinet selection, routed intercepted browser downloads into the selected Cabinet, and preserved migrated legacy capture download links.
- Added **Upload** and **Finalize Uploads** Agent actions. Upload selects the newest unuploaded Cabinet item, supports ordinary files, ZIPs, compatible folders, native file inputs, file choosers, and drop targets; Finalize Uploads marks all items attached during the execution.
- Documented the Cabinet Task field and upload action contract in `AGENT_SPEC.md`.

### Editor and interface
- Added extension-aware monochrome file icons for Cabinet and execution downloads, plus the dedicated Material Symbols CSV glyph throughout action UI.
- Added direct, reload-safe URLs for Settings tabs and individual Cabinets, including invalid-Cabinet fallback to the default Cabinet.
- Added Option-number sidebar navigation support on macOS, improved sidebar add-button affordance, made loop variables unavailable outside a For Each scope, and refined Cabinet controls and proxy rotation settings.
- Replaced Cabinet browser prompts with the app's glass modal treatment, removed the theme introduction prompt, and updated the package description to describe the product directly.

### Reliability and qualification
- Added and hardened deterministic v1 qualification coverage for browser execution, control-flow blocks, persistence, scheduler behavior, Docker startup, PostgreSQL migration, headful operation, and concurrent execution.
- Corrected false-positive qualification assertions and CI setup, isolated qualification API keys, and tightened Docker cleanup and health verification.
- Added rate limiting to Cabinet download, migrated-capture, Cabinet view, and SPA fallback handlers in response to CodeQL findings.

### Documentation and maintenance
- Updated CLI/release documentation and application dependencies.

## [0.16.1] - 2026-08-30

### Canvas loop redesign
- Redesigned `while`, `repeat`, and `foreach` loop actions as atomic canvas blocks with rounded return-path connectors, replacing the previous loop layout with a rendering style consistent with `if` blocks.
- Added shared action-block helpers (`src/utils/actionBlocks.ts`) for identifying block-start/loop action types, matching a block's start to its `end` marker, computing a block's action range, and expanding a set of selected action ids to fully include any block they belong to.
- Enabled constrained cross-scope action dragging on the canvas, so an action or block can be dragged into a different branch/loop scope while staying within valid drop targets, and refined the closed-loop connector paths to route cleanly around the redesigned loop blocks.

### Block testing
- Added a "Run through block" tester to the action configuration modal, letting a single block be executed in a temporary headless browser from the start of the Task up through the selected block, without running extraction, recording, or persistent session state.
- Added a redesigned block configuration workspace showing resolved inputs, expected output, live variable snapshots, execution logs, and a screenshot of the page after the tested block ran, alongside status (success, error, skipped, stopped, not reached) and duration.
- Added the ability to stop an in-flight block test, including canceling the underlying execution on the server.
- Fixed a bug where starting a block test could immediately and silently abort itself: auto-saving the Task right before the test request re-created the test-stop callback, and an effect that treated any change to that callback as a reason to run its cleanup ended up canceling the test that had just started. The cleanup now only fires on the modal actually unmounting.

### Variable insertion
- Added drag-and-drop variable insertion into plain text/code inputs (`CodeEditor`) and rich text inputs (`RichInput`), placing the dropped variable token at the caret position under the cursor.
- Extracted shared variable-insertion helpers (`src/utils/variableDrag.ts`) and a reusable variable list/palette component (`ConfigVariableList`) used by the new block configuration workspace.

### Task versions
- Added the ability to permanently delete an individual saved Task version, alongside the existing version preview, rollback, and clear-all actions.
- Added explicit loading state while a new version is being created or an existing one deleted, so the versions panel no longer allows overlapping requests.

### Editor
- Split the action configuration modal into a shared `ConfigModalShell` plus dedicated `BlockConfigWorkspace` and `ExecutionConfigModal` surfaces, aligning its layout with the new block-testing and variable-insertion functionality.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-08-29

### Execution outcomes
- Added automatic `stopped`, `crashed`, and `anti_bot` outcomes alongside `success` and `error` for Agent and Scrape executions. Cancellation requests, unhandled runtime failures, and unresolved bot challenges now retain distinct final states across the runtime, scheduler, API summaries, run history, execution details, and editor results.
- Added shared outcome classification and normalization, including deterministic precedence for overlapping terminal conditions and backwards-compatible handling of historical execution records.
- Documented the execution-outcome contract in `AGENT_SPEC.md` and added focused coverage for classification, normalization, cancellation, runtime failures, and anti-bot detection.

### Dashboard and application redesign
- Redesigned the Dashboard, Executions, Execution Detail, Captures, Settings, loading, and not-found pages around the editor canvas's compact controls, layered surfaces, thin borders, and node-like panels while preserving the existing global icon sidebar and theme system.
- Added an n8n-inspired Dashboard overview with real Task and execution metrics, searchable compact Task rows, sorting by recent activity, name, mode, or action count, and schedule, target, mode, and last-opened metadata.
- Replaced inline Task edit/delete controls with single-click opening and a canvas-styled overflow menu offering Open, Copy Link, Copy API URL, and Delete actions.
- Reworked Run History into a denser, filterable execution list with summary metrics, clearer outcome hierarchy, and a structured execution-detail header and metadata strip without changing virtualization or output rendering.
- Reworked Captures into a compact media library with direct open, download, copy, and delete actions plus redesigned loading and empty states.
- Added a responsive secondary Settings navigator for API Keys, AI Models, User Agent, Proxies, Appearance, and About. Removed the standalone Storage section while retaining the existing capture-management APIs and standalone Captures page.

### Controls and accessibility
- Replaced native browser selects and datalists throughout the application with reusable, theme-aware custom select and combobox controls supporting keyboard navigation, portals, viewport-aware positioning, optional icons, and mixed option content.
- Kept dropdown labels in normal casing and added monochrome provider icons for reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, and Cloudflare CAPTCHA choices while retaining the generic Auto icon.
- Shared extraction-field option definitions between the canvas and Task Settings editors so both extraction surfaces remain synchronized.

### Fixes and polish
- Prevented unauthenticated application startup from attempting to fetch Tasks before a session is available.
- Removed the dark background highlight behind block names in the editor canvas.

## [0.15.2] - 2026-08-28

### Bug fixes
- Preserved hand-written extraction JavaScript when switching between the Visual and JavaScript editors. Mode changes now update only the selected editor mode, while actual visual field edits continue to regenerate the visual script.
- Changed missing or `unknown` execution sources to `api`, so API-triggered runs display and filter correctly in both the execution list and detail view, including historical records.

### UI
- Automatically expanded the **On Execution** block whenever a new task is created, including tasks initialized by navigating directly to `/tasks/new`; existing tasks still open with the block collapsed.
- Displayed dashboard task favicons in their original full color instead of applying a grayscale filter.
- Replaced the animated README demo GIF with a static product screenshot while retaining links to the video walkthroughs.

### Deployment
- Added `docker-compose.deploy.yml` as a production-oriented Compose configuration using the published GHCR image, persistent data and capture mounts, exposed application and noVNC ports, and an automatic restart policy.

### Cleanup and documentation
- Removed the deprecated `OHMYCAPTCHA_URL` and `OHMYCAPTCHA_CLIENT_KEY` aliases and their documentation; remote CAPTCHA solving now uses `CAPTCHA_SOLVER_URL` and `CAPTCHA_SOLVER_KEY`. The obsolete ignored OhMyCAPTCHA checkout and ignore rule were also removed.
- Added a roadmap item for per-automation downloads folders and an upload block that selects files from an automation's file workspace.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-08-25

### CAPTCHA reliability
- Added a **Wait for CAPTCHA** action block that pauses until a CAPTCHA checkbox or equivalent provider control is initialized, visible, enabled, pointer-receivable, and stable, without clicking or solving it. The block supports provider filtering, selector scoping, configurable timeouts, and result variables.
- Added pre-navigation interception for Cloudflare managed Turnstile challenges, capturing the one-time site key, action, `cData`, `chlPageData`, callback, and user agent required by compatible remote solvers. Supports the field conventions used by both 2Captcha and AntiCaptcha-compatible endpoints.
- Fixed Cloudflare Challenge pages whose site keys appear only inside challenge-frame URL paths, while preserving standalone Turnstile support.
- Fixed reCAPTCHA iframe recognition on `www.google.com`, allowing the solver to proceed from the checkbox into 3×3/4×4 image grids instead of silently skipping the challenge.
- Hardened local reCAPTCHA/hCaptcha solving with interactable-control checks, vision-backend readiness, delayed grid detection, replacement-tile handling, and verified token completion.
- Auto-solve now checks the initial task navigation as well as later navigate/click/type actions, with a bounded readiness-detection window.
- CAPTCHA failures now produce explicit sanitized provider/local diagnostics and an errored block status while retaining the existing `On Error` or log-and-continue execution behavior.

### Tests
- Added deterministic coverage for CAPTCHA readiness waits, timeouts, selector scoping, managed Turnstile interception, provider payload dialects, callback injection, and Google/Cloudflare iframe URL parsing.
- Verified readiness against the public standalone Turnstile, Cloudflare Challenge, and reCAPTCHA v2 demos.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-08-22

### Solve CAPTCHAs from Agent mode
 Agent mode can now solve reCAPTCHA v2, reCAPTCHA v3, hCaptcha, and Cloudflare Turnstile challenges without leaving the task flow. Solves are routed through an optional YesCaptcha/AntiCaptcha-compatible remote endpoint first, then fall back to a built-in active-browser local model (OWL-ViT on 2–7.99 GiB hosts, Florence-2 at 8 GiB\+). Local weights are fetched on first use into persistent `data/captcha-model/`; nothing is bundled into the image.
 
### `Do Nothing` action block
A new `do_nothing` action block is available in the block picker. Drop it onto the canvas as a placeholder while you're drafting a task, or use it as the body of an `If` or `On Error` branch when you want the branch to fall through without side effects.

  - The block takes no configuration. It logs `Do nothing` and completes successfully.
  - `noop` and `pass` are accepted as aliases and behave identically.

  ### API trigger endpoint now accepts bodyless requests

  `POST /api/tasks/:id/api` no longer requires a JSON body or a `Content-Type: application/json` header. Requests without a parsed body are treated as `{}` and the task runs with its default variables. Tools that can't set request headers on outbound calls (for example, Clay's HTTP action) can now trigger a task with a bare `POST` to the endpoint URL.

### Full endpoint URL and method in the API trigger panel

The task editor's **Trigger via API** panel now shows the complete origin-aware endpoint URL (for example, `https://your-figranium.example.com/api/tasks/task_1/api`) with a `POST` method badge next to it. The copy button copies the same full URL, so you can paste it straight into external tools without prefixing your instance origin by hand.

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix a 500 crash in `executeTaskById` when external callers send requests without a JSON `Content-Type`** - Callers such as Clay that POST without setting `Content-Type: application/json` left `req.body` undefined, crashing the task API trigger; `server.js` now handles this case.

### UI
- **Redesign All Captures screen to a two-column grid** - Removed virtualized list scrolling in favor of a simpler two-column grid layout.

### Chores
- Removed the unused `src/agent/figranite/captcha/` detection/handoff module (`CaptchaDetectionObserver`, `CaptchaHandoffCoordinator`, `MemoryGuard`, etc.) and its two dedicated tests — it predated this release, was never wired into the runtime (TypeScript under a `noEmit` backend build, so nothing could `require()` it), and is superseded by the new `solve_captcha` implementation.
- Regenerated the demo GIF, MP4, and WebM media files.

## [0.14.4] - 2026-08-20

### Features
- **Dual browser engine switch: Playwright stealth stack by default, CloakBrowser opt-in via `USE_CLOAK_ENGINE`** (#349) - `stealth-chromium.js` now exposes a single adapter (`launch`, `launchPersistentContext`, plus a chromium-shaped export for existing callers) that routes to either `playwright-extra` + `puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth` (the default) or the CloakBrowser stealth-patched Chromium binary when `USE_CLOAK_ENGINE=true`; `CLOAKBROWSER_LICENSE_KEY` is read natively by `cloakbrowser` to unlock the latest binary. `scripts/postinstall.js` pre-fetches the CloakBrowser binary only when the engine is enabled, otherwise installing Playwright browsers as before. Documented both env vars in `AGENTS.md` and the README config table, and added a commented-out example to `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Rewrite Scrape mode to use `got-scraping` and Cheerio instead of Playwright** - Scrape mode no longer launches a browser: it fetches pages via a lightweight `got-scraping` HTTP request and parses them with Cheerio, dropping screenshot and video capture while preserving selector extraction, shadow-DOM-free HTML cleanup, link extraction, proxy/user-agent rotation, headful cookie handoff, and the existing extraction-worker sandboxed script pipeline. The results panel now shows "Scrape mode does not support screenshots" instead of the misleading "Waiting for Frame..." placeholder when viewing scrape-mode results.
- **Auto-dismiss IDCAC cookie-consent banners in Agent mode** - Injects the `idcac-playwright` cookie-banner-dismissal script into every Agent mode browser context so runs no longer need to manually click through cookie consent dialogs. Documented the GPLv3-licensed `idcac-playwright`, noVNC, and websockify third-party components in `NOTICE`.

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix IDCAC cookie-consent dismissal never actually running in Agent mode** - `idcac-playwright`'s injectable script synchronously inserts a `<style>` element via `document.head.appendChild()`, but it was being run via `context.addInitScript()`, which fires before `<head>` is parsed; the resulting `TypeError` was silently swallowed by the script's own outer `try/catch`, so IDCAC never actually clicked anything. Switched to running the script via `page.evaluate()` on each page's `domcontentloaded` event (the package's documented usage pattern), applied to the current page and every future page/navigation in the context.

### CI
- Added a `workflow_dispatch` trigger to the Publish Docker Image workflow for manual runs, and generated Docker tags for non-main branches so those manual runs can push to GHCR from any branch.

### Chores
- Deleted the `node_modules` directory that had been accidentally committed, to prevent bloat when cloning.
- Resynced `package-lock.json` with `package.json`'s earlier removal of the `@google/gemini-cli` dependency.
- Updated the `NOTICE` file's maintainer/copyright name from Mnemosyne to Figranium.

## [0.14.3] - 2026-08-17

### Features
- **Visual field-mapping mode for extraction scripts** - Added a Visual/JavaScript toggle to the task-level Extraction Script editor (both the canvas "Extraction Script" block and the Task Settings extraction tab), defaulting to Visual. In Visual mode, users map field names to page content by selector — with Text/HTML/Input Value/Attribute extraction modes and a "multiple" toggle for list results — using the existing headful/VNC selector picker, with no raw JavaScript shown; the underlying `extractionScript` is auto-generated from the field mapping and kept in sync. Switching to JavaScript mode surfaces the generated script, still fully editable, and existing tasks with a hand-written script keep opening in JavaScript mode automatically. Selector candidates using the Playwright-only `:has-text(...)` pseudo-selector are filtered out for extraction-field picks, since extraction scripts run through native `document.querySelector` which doesn't support it.

### UI
- Removed close-on-backdrop-click from the canvas Extraction Script modal so it no longer dismisses accidentally while interacting with its contents; the Visual/JavaScript mode toggle now shows a solid fill on the selected option instead of a subtle border.

## [0.14.2] - 2026-08-15

### Bug Fixes
- **Restore backdrop blur on modals and overlay panels in Dark and Solarized Dark themes** - A theme CSS override was force-replacing translucent `bg-black/NN` backgrounds with a fully opaque solid color regardless of whether the element also had a `backdrop-blur-*` class, defeating the blur on the Task Settings panel, the confirm modal, and several other modals/overlays. Removed the incorrect dark-theme override (light theme was already correct). The confirm modal card itself had separately been hardcoded to a fully opaque `var(--app-surface)` when an earlier fix addressed it rendering nearly invisible on light themes; it now uses a translucent, theme-aware background with blur restored, keeping the light-theme contrast fix while no longer flattening the modal in dark themes.
- **Fix headful VNC session stuck in a "Reconnecting..." loop** - `start-vnc.sh` was embedding literal double-quote characters into the `x11vnc` `-passwd` argument due to unquoted shell word-splitting of an escaped-quote string, so x11vnc's actual password never matched the password handed to the noVNC client, causing every connection attempt to fail authentication and immediately disconnect. Switched to a bash array for the x11vnc arguments so the password is passed as a single unmodified argument; verified with a real RFB authentication handshake against the running container.
- **Fix proxy credentials embedded in a pasted URL not being split out** - Proxies added by pasting a full `http://user:pass@host:port` URL into the Server field stored the entire URL (credentials included) as the `server` value instead of splitting out `username`/`password`, causing the Settings > Proxies list to display the same URL twice and causing those proxies to fail upstream authentication when used in a rotation pool. `normalizeProxy` now parses embedded credentials out of `server` on both the add and bulk-import paths; existing broken entries self-heal automatically since proxy config is already re-normalized on every read.
- **Fix browser tools (open and highlight) on Mac** (#344) - Resolved macOS-specific compatibility issues in the headful selector-picker's open/highlight tools, including escaping backslash characters in an attribute selector query that CodeQL flagged.
- **Fix Figranium icon rendering black on dark theme** - The logo SVG had its own `prefers-color-scheme` media query inverting its fill, which conflicted with the app's existing `data-theme`-driven `filter: invert(1)` rule in `index.css`; when both applied, the inversions canceled out or disagreed, leaving the icon black or invisible depending on OS/app theme combination. The SVG is now a single self-theming asset with a plain fill, letting the app's `data-theme` attribute be the sole source of truth for logo color.
- **Fix dashboard empty-state centering** - The empty task-list grid wrapper still rendered as an empty flex sibling next to the "Create First Task" block with zero tasks, splitting the available space and throwing off centering; now only one branch renders depending on whether tasks exist.

### Improvements
- Delayed the GitHub Star prompt until after multiple successful runs and a 3-day wait, and changed its entrance to a sudden slide-in instead of the previous animation.
- Added short descriptive subtitles under the Dashboard, Run History, and Settings headings, matching the Captures page; removed the Settings "Data" tab (Captures/Cookies panels moved to the standalone Captures page).
- Bumped the Dashboard, Run History, All Captures, and Settings page headings to a larger, bolder weight; widened the Settings page to match other pages' content width.
- Reworked the dashboard header: dropped the GitHub star pill (still shown on Settings), moved the search bar into the button row instead of absolute-centering it (it was overlapping the Export button), and swapped overlapping hover-scale button effects for a hover brightness change on adjacent button pairs.
- Raised all sub-12px text across the app to a legible `text-xs` floor, added password-confirmation validation to account setup and inline error messaging to the Proxies panel instead of silently no-opping on empty required fields, and extracted a shared `PanelShell`/`LoadingState`/`EmptyState` component to de-duplicate the Captures/Cookies/Proxies settings panels.
- Remade and replaced the Figranium demo video/GIF walkthrough with a higher-quality recording, and updated the capture script to auto-dismiss the theme intro modal so it doesn't block the recording.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-08-12

### Features
- **Polite value-driven GitHub Star conversion loop and social proof headers** (#342) - Added a non-intrusive `GithubStarPrompt` component that tracks starred/dismissed/opened state via `localStorage` and delays its appearance until after a successful run; clicking "I've starred it!" redirects to the GitHub repo with guidance text. Embedded inside the editor `ResultsPane` at the high-delight moment right after execution succeeds, alongside new social proof headers.

### Security
- **Cryptographically secure randomness for proxy selection and viewport sizing** - Replaced `Math.random()` with `crypto.randomInt()` in `proxy-rotation.js`'s `getNextProxy`, and in randomized viewport dimension generation in `scrape.js` and `src/agent/browser.js`, closing a CodeQL "insecure randomness" finding.
- **Harden proxy credential normalization** - `normalizeProxy` in `proxy-utils.js` now maps null/empty/undefined username and password fields to `undefined` so they're excluded from saved configs; `headful.js`, `scrape.js`, and `src/agent/browser.js` sanitize proxy option objects passed to Playwright to only include truthy credentials, preventing a null-property crash in rotating proxy pools (#341).

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix Task Settings Panel unreadable on Light and Solarized Light themes** (#340) - Made the panel theme-aware instead of using hardcoded colors.
- **Fix Docker arm64 builds and headful VNC access on Apple Silicon** (#337, #338) - Removed the redundant `npx playwright install` step since the `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright` base image already ships native per-architecture browser binaries (~1GB smaller images per platform); bound noVNC/websockify to `0.0.0.0:54311` so Docker Desktop on Apple Silicon hosts can reach the VNC port, while connecting to the VNC backend via explicit loopback IPv4 `127.0.0.1:5900` to avoid IPv4/IPv6 address-family mismatches.

### Improvements
- Added theme-aware light/dark logo variants for the Swiftproxy, SimplyNode, and Mintlify partner badges in the README; reorganized the README's Official Partners/Infrastructure Backers sections and heading hierarchy.

### Tests
- Added unit test cases to `tests/proxy-utils.test.js` covering normalization of rotating pools with falsy, null, or empty credentials.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-08-10

### Features
- **Programmatic browser & inspector API** (#334) - New authenticated endpoints expose core headful workflows for external orchestration: `POST /api/browser/open` launches or reattaches a managed headful session and returns a `sessionId`/`wsEndpoint`; `POST /api/inspector/highlight` activates the inspect overlay and returns candidate CSS/XPath selectors with confidence scores; `PATCH /api/tasks/:id` performs partial task updates with version snapshots; `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` now cleans up in-process schedules on delete. All routes support both session and API key auth (#334) and are covered by `tests/api_endpoints.test.js` (26 tests).
- **Multi-theme support** - Added Dark, Light, Solarized Light, and Solarized Dark themes (`theme.ts`, `useTheme` hook, `ThemePanel`, `ThemeIntroModal`), applied via CSS custom properties.
- **CAPTCHA/form detection engine (foundational)** - Added `src/agent/figranite/captcha/`: a DOM/shadow-DOM/iframe observer that classifies interactive elements (slider, audio, grid, rotational, distorted-text, widget-frame, form) and emits structured detection events with coordinates, a 2GB memory guardrail (`os.totalmem()` + cgroup v1/v2 limits), and typed human-handoff hooks (`onCaptchaDetected`, `pauseForHuman`, `submitSolution`) that pipe externally supplied solution coordinates into the existing mouse trajectory generator. Detection and handoff only — no automated solving logic.

### Security
- **Fix unauthenticated VNC/websockify access** - `server.js`, `start-vnc.sh`, and `public/novnc.html` updated so the noVNC/websockify proxy path requires authentication.
- **Bind websockify to IPv4 loopback explicitly** (#335) - Avoids IPv6/IPv4 loopback mismatches inside Docker on Mac that could cause the VNC stream to bind unexpectedly.
- **Path traversal sanitization for sessionId** - Added strict validation for `sessionId` and `taskId` before use in file lookups.
- **Enforce strict raw-cron range and ordering validation** (#324) - Closes an edge case where malformed cron ranges could pass validation.
- Fixed CodeQL alerts surfaced across the browser/session and cron-validation code paths (#325, #322).

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix local loopback WebSocket disconnects on Mac/Docker** (#331, #333) - Resolved dropped WebSocket connections and a loading-state flash in `HeadfulModal` affecting Mac/Docker hosts.
- **Resolve path mismatch for generated captures** (#336) - Captures generated during a run were not reliably surfacing in the frontend; capture lookup now matches the actual write path.
- **Fix captures not surfacing in Docker** - `server.js` and `src/server/routes/data.js` now serve/read captures from both `public/captures` locations.
- **Persist captures to a host volume** - Captures survive container restarts; runtime capture artifacts were untracked from git.
- **Fix theme-switching contrast regressions** - Corrected an invisible canvas dot-grid on light themes, buttons rendering white-on-white text under theme-accent backgrounds, and unreadable hardcoded blue accent text; retuned syntax/code colors across all four themes for WCAG AA contrast.
- Resolved an illegal `return` statement bug in custom JS actions and corrected outdated test imports.

### Improvements
- **Persistent browser session storage** - Session IDs now persist across reconnects instead of being regenerated per session.
- **Demo assets** (#328, #329) - Recorded and embedded an updated demo GIF/video of typical Figranium usage; automated future walkthrough generation.
- **Exported task filename** (#330) - Task export filename pattern changed from `doppelganger-tasks` to `figranium-tasks`.
- Replaced JetBrains Mono with Space Mono across CSS/Tailwind config; added Algolia logo to README; synchronized `package-lock.json` with `package.json` to fix `npm ci` failures (#326).

### Tests
- Added a comprehensive end-to-end user journey test with Playwright (#327).
- Added `tests/api_endpoints.test.js` (26 tests) covering the new programmatic browser/inspector/task API surface.
- Added unit tests for the new CAPTCHA memory guard and DOM detection/routing observer.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-08-05

### Features
- **Programmatic API endpoints (initial cut)** - Introduced the browser launcher, highlight inspector, task update, and task deletion endpoints later hardened with auth in 0.14.0.

### Improvements
- **Demo walkthrough automation** (#328, #329) - Recorded and embedded high-quality demo video/GIF walkthroughs.
- **Exported task filename** (#330) - Changed exported task filename prefix from `doppelganger-tasks` to `figranium-tasks`.
- Replaced JetBrains Mono with Space Mono from Google Fonts across CSS and Tailwind configuration.

### Tests
- Added a comprehensive E2E user journey test with Playwright (#327).

## [0.13.1] - 2026-07-30

### Security
- **Fix unauthenticated VNC and websockify access** - Closed a path where the noVNC/websockify proxy could be reached without authentication.
- **CodeQL alert remediation** (#325, #322) - Addressed static-analysis findings across session and browser handling code.
- **Path traversal sanitization** - Added sanitization for `sessionId` and strict validation for `taskId` before use in fetches.
- **Enforce strict raw-cron range and ordering validation** (#324) - Prevents malformed cron field ranges/ordering from being accepted.

### Bug Fixes
- **Persistent session ID storage** - Browser session IDs are now persisted rather than regenerated each session.
- Fixed outdated test imports and an illegal `return` statement bug in custom JS actions.
- Fixed search bar overlapping import/export buttons on tablet viewports.

### Improvements
- Improved Dashboard header responsiveness for iPad (#320).
- Synchronized `package-lock.json` with `package.json` direct dependencies to fix `npm ci` failures (#326).
- README cleanup: added sponsors/backers section, updated logo, removed unused `public/logo.png`/`public/icon.png`.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-06-29

### Critical Architectural Pivot
* **Retired NPM Distribution:** The figranium NPM package is officially retired. Local Node.js and Playwright binary management are no longer supported.
* **Strict Containerization:** Figranium has migrated entirely to an isolated Docker-first architecture. The full Express backend, Vite/React UI, and execution layers are now deployed together via uniform container sandboxes to guarantee 100% execution determinism across all environments.

### Core Backend & Engine Fixes
* **Restored AI Selector Generation:** Fixed a silent backend orchestration failure that caused the legacy AI selector tool to stall. The engine now reliably analyzes DOM structural fragments and returns clean, human-readable selector strings.
* **Added Selector Mode Toggle:** Introduced a configuration switch directly inside the action block panel. Users can now seamlessly toggle between AI Selector Generation Mode for rapid prototyping and the Native Browser Selection Tool for exact viewport inspection.
* **Codebase Optimization:** Executed a massive code refactor to strip out dead utility paths, unused backend modules, and legacy NPM setup configurations.

### UI & Layout Ergonomics
* **Tablet Layout Responsiveness:** Resolved an interface bug on tablet and iPad viewports where the dashboard header container compressed elements. The task filter search bar and export action buttons now utilize responsive breakpoints to prevent layout overlaps.

### Database Infrastructure Enhancements
* **Schema Robustness:** Updated API key columns in src/server/db.js from VARCHAR(255) to TEXT, including automated migration logic to update existing installations seamlessly.
* **Feature Parity:** Implemented missing table definitions and storage logic for Ollama API keys, Credentials, AI Models, and Proxy configurations to ensure full parity with disk-based storage.
* **Cloud SSL Support:** Integrated PostgreSQL SSL support toggled via the DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL environment variable, enabling secure connections to managed cloud database providers like Aiven.
* **Architectural Integration:** Refactored proxy-rotation.js to natively support database storage and integrated the routine directly into the main application initialization flow within server.js.
* **Integration Testing:** Added tests/db-integration.test.js using a mocked PostgreSQL pool to thoroughly verify database interactions across all storage modules.

## [0.12.2] - 2026-04-11

### Security
- **Ollama SSRF hardening** (#284) - Settings and task routes now validate Ollama configuration and API targets more strictly, preventing unsafe outbound requests to internal hosts.

### Performance
- **Cron next-run calculation** (#285) - `src/server/cron-parser.js` now calculates the next execution time more efficiently, with a dedicated regression/perf test added in `tests/cron-perf.test.js`.
- **Sandbox proxy optimization** (#282) - Browser sandbox proxy handling was streamlined for better identity handling and lower overhead in extraction flows.

### Improvements
- **Block editing interactions** - Blocks now open their settings on double-click, while the block type label uses a short click delay so a second click can switch from the action palette to block settings. The tweaked interaction keeps single-click type changes responsive without stealing the double-click path.
- **Shortcut discoverability and task card actions** (#283) - Task card and sidebar keyboard cues were polished to make action discovery more obvious from the dashboard.
- **TypeScript config cleanup** - `tsconfig.json` was adjusted to resolve a lint/type-check issue uncovered during the release cycle.

### Tests
- Added `tests/cron-perf.test.js` to guard the cron scheduler optimization.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-04-08

### Security
- **Block `host.docker.internal` in SSRF protection** (#275) - `url-utils.js` updated to explicitly reject this host even when `ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORKS` is enabled, preventing potential internal network probes via Docker bridges.
- **Stricter network defaults** - `ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORKS` is now disabled by default.

### Features
- **Global AI model settings** - Added support for configuring default AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.) site-wide in system settings.
- **`get_content` action** - New built-in action to extract full page content (HTML, text, or markdown) directly without custom extraction scripts.
- **Extractor worker migration** - Extraction scripts now run in a dedicated worker for better isolation and performance.

### Performance
- **Vite Upgrade** - Upgraded to Vite 7.3.2 for improved build performance and security.

### Improvements
- **Capture cleanup** (#276) - Recordings are now automatically deleted when clearing captures in system settings.
- **Code health** (#272) - Reduced scheduler log noise by removing unnecessary startup/shutdown logs.
- **Environment consistency** - Renamed internal environment variables for Playwright installation for improved clarity.

### Tests
- Added comprehensive test suite for the **Execution Queue Limiter** (#271).

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-07

### Performance
- **PostgreSQL Optimization** (#264) - Implemented in-memory counters for execution logging to significantly reduce DB pressure during high-concurrency workloads.
- **Finalization Optimization** (#262) - Streamlined agent execution finalization process to reduce overhead and latency.
- **Dashboard Rendering** (#259) - Extracted and memoized `TaskCard` components to improve Dashboard responsiveness with large task libraries.

### Improvements
- **Shortcuts & Navigation** (#257, #260) - Added `Ctrl+Enter` shortcut to run tasks directly from the editor or action palette.
- **UI Consistency** (#255) - Implemented standardized `Escape` key dismissal for all major editor overlays (Settings, Palette, Context Menus, etc.).
- **Capture Management** (#253) - Enhanced the captures UI with icon-only action bars, visual type indicators (photo/video), and background loading states.

## [0.11.4] - 2026-04-01

### Security
- **[HIGH] Fix SSRF via webhook redirects** (#237) - Playwright navigation and redirect handling in `scrape.js`, `headful.js`, `server.js`, and `src/agent/browser.js` now validates destination URLs through `validateUrl` before following redirects, closing a vector where a crafted page could redirect the browser to an internal network address. `url-utils.js` gained comprehensive redirect-chain validation with a new test suite (`tests/sentinel_ssrf_verification.js`).
- **[HIGH] Harden session security and protect status endpoints** (#241) - Session cookies are now issued with `httpOnly: true` to mitigate XSS-based session theft. `GET /api/headful/status` now requires authentication (previously unauthenticated). `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) headers are set automatically when secure cookies are enabled.
- **Fix SSRF in Baserow output provider and credentials route** (#244) - `src/server/outputProviders/baserow.js` and `src/server/routes/credentials.js` now route all outbound requests through `validateUrl`, preventing a workflow author from pointing the Baserow provider at an internal host. Extended SSRF test coverage added to `tests/sentinel_ssrf_verification.js`; added `tests/repro_baserow_ssrf.js` as a standalone regression test.
- **[HIGH] Fix sandbox escape via getPrototypeOf** (#248) - `src/agent/sandbox.js` now installs a `getPrototypeOf` trap on the security proxy, blocking the `Object.getPrototypeOf(proxy).constructor` escape path that could have allowed extraction scripts to reach the host Node.js environment. Regression test added in `tests/sandbox_escape_v3.test.js`.

### Features
- **Dashboard task search** (#250) - A search bar (shortcut `/`) appears in the Dashboard header. Tasks are filtered live by name or URL using a case-insensitive `useMemo` match. Includes a "Clear" button and a "No matching tasks" empty state. Fully keyboard-accessible with `aria-label` and focus management.
- **Activity Log copy button** (#243) - A one-click Copy button appears in the ResultsPane Activity Log tab, making it easy to capture the full execution log for debugging or sharing.
- **Dashboard quick-copy URL** (#247) - A copy-URL button appears on hover/focus on each task card in the Dashboard, allowing the task's target URL to be copied without opening the editor. Missing `aria-label`/`title` attributes added to Export, Import, and New Task buttons.

### Performance
- **Task list API payload** (#235) - `GET /api/tasks/list` no longer serializes the full version history of each task. Version data is already fetched on demand inside the editor, so stripping it from the list response significantly reduces payload size and server/client memory pressure on large task libraries.
- **Editor history serialization** (#238) - `useEditorHistory` now uses a more efficient diffing strategy, measurably reducing serialization overhead for tasks with large action lists.
- **Agent execution loop** (#239) - `actionContext` construction is fully hoisted outside the inner execution loop in `src/agent/index.js`, eliminating repeated allocations on every action step.
- **Syntax highlighting** (#242) - `src/utils/syntaxHighlight.ts` rewritten to avoid redundant regex passes; produces the same output with less CPU time on large token streams.
- **ResultsPane large string handling** (#245) - Long result strings are now truncated before being passed into the renderer, preventing the UI thread from blocking on huge payloads.
- **ResultsPane large data preview** (#249) - Object/array previews in ResultsPane are capped before JSON serialization, keeping the panel responsive even when results contain thousands of records.
- **Table data detection and header discovery** (#252) - `getTableData` now samples the first 200 items (matching the preview limit) for type detection instead of scanning the full array, and uses a `Set` for header tracking. Benchmarks show ~70x speedup for detection on 100 000-item arrays (3.24 ms to 0.04 ms); header discovery is now O(K) instead of O(K*H).

### Bug Fixes
- **Sticky notes: multi-move, color fix, plain-text display** - Rubber-band-selecting multiple sticky notes and dragging now moves all selected notes together. Color-swatch clicks no longer dismiss edit mode (mousedown `preventDefault`). Note body renders as plain monospace text rather than Markdown (markdown display caused confusing interactions with the editor's own markdown fields).

### Improvements
- **Action Palette UX and accessibility** (#236) - `aria-label` added to the search input; `title`/`aria-label` added to the Close and Clear buttons; auto-focus behaviour corrected to avoid interfering with screen readers; `Escape` key now dismisses the palette cleanly; focus rings made consistent with the rest of the editor.
- **StickyNote accessibility and micro-UX** (#240) - Keyboard focus and ARIA roles added to sticky note interactive elements; color picker interaction polished.
- **RichInput accessibility** (#243) - ARIA attributes added to the custom `RichInput` component; focus-visible rings added to all interactive sub-elements.
- **Canvas background contrast** - Canvas grid dots lowered in contrast for a less visually noisy editing surface.

## [0.11.3] - 2026-03-25

### Features
- **Task Descriptions** - Tasks now support an optional `description` field. Edit it in the Task Settings panel (always visible above the tab bar). The description renders on the canvas inside the trigger card and is included in the `GET /api/tasks/list` response so AI agents and operators have context without fetching the full task.

## [0.11.2] - 2026-03-24

### Features
- **Sticky Notes on Canvas** - Right-click the canvas background to add sticky notes. Notes support full Markdown rendering (headings, bold, italic, code, lists, tables, etc.), are draggable and resizable, and sit on the layer below blocks. Available in five colors: default, yellow, pink, green, and purple. Positions and sizes are stored as integers in canvas world coordinates. Sticky notes participate in the rubber-band selection tool and support Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V copy-paste alongside blocks.

### Improvements
- **Editor Performance** - Excluded `versions` from task snapshot stringification for a ~23x speedup in change detection. Wrapped `ActionItem` in `React.memo` and stabilized callbacks in `EditorScreen`/`CanvasView` to eliminate unnecessary re-renders.
- **Agent Execution Loop** - Hoisted static `actionOptions` and `actionContext` construction outside the main execution loop, reducing per-step overhead by ~32% and lowering GC pressure on long-running tasks.
- **Trigger Header Accessibility** - Converted the "On Execution" trigger header from a `div` to a semantic `<button>` with `aria-expanded`, `aria-label`, `title`, and keyboard focus ring support.
- **Password Input Accessibility** - Added a visibility toggle to password fields.

### Security
- **[CRITICAL] Fix Sandbox Escape in Extraction Scripts** - Fixed a proxy bypass in `src/agent/sandbox.js` that allowed extraction scripts to escape the sandbox via unproxied `this` in callbacks.
- **API Key Endpoint Hardening** - Fixed a missing `await` on `saveApiKey`, added 512-character input length validation, and applied CSRF protection and rate limiting middleware to all state-changing settings endpoints.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-03-22

### Security
- **[HIGH] Fix Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH)** - WebSocket upgrade handler now validates the `Origin` header against the server's host. Added `isValidWebSocketOrigin` utility to `url-utils.js` and a dedicated test suite to verify the protection.
- **[MEDIUM] Harden internal auth bypass against IP spoofing** - `requireApiKey` now reads `req.socket.remoteAddress` for loopback verification instead of `X-Forwarded-For`, preventing external attackers from bypassing the local-agent whitelist when `TRUST_PROXY` is enabled.
- **Remove vulnerable `openssl` npm package** - dependency removed; it was unused in application code and had a known CVE (GHSA-75w2-qv55-x7fv).

### Features
- **FigClaw integration layer** - foundational backend infrastructure for FigClaw to use Figranium as a programmatic execution backend:
  - `GET /api/health` endpoint with DB connectivity check.
  - Graceful SIGTERM/SIGINT shutdown (flushes in-flight executions, stops scheduler, closes DB).
  - Execution concurrency limiter (`MAX_CONCURRENT_EXECUTIONS` env var; unlimited by default).
  - Completion webhook: optional `webhookUrl` on `POST /tasks/:id/api` (SSRF-validated).
  - Task CRUD endpoints now accept API key auth alongside session auth.
  - `flushExecutions()` added to the storage layer for safe shutdown of debounced writes.
- **Proxies Panel UX enhancement** - loading state and input validation on "Add Proxy", focus-visible rings on all interactive buttons, descriptive ARIA labels and tooltips on icon-only actions.
- **Cookies Panel accessibility improvements** - standardized focus-visible rings, `aria-label`/`title` attributes on all action buttons, integrated `CopyButton` per cookie row, cookie value toggle converted to a semantic `<button>` with `aria-expanded`.
- **Updated page title** - title changed to "Figranium | Build complex browser workflows visually" to better reflect product positioning.

### Improvements
- **Optimize task serialization for change detection** - replaced `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` in `serializeTaskSnapshot` with object destructuring, yielding ~5x faster change detection with no allocation overhead.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-19

### Security
- **[HIGH] Fix protocol validation bypass in `validateUrl`** - protocols were not being checked strictly, allowing potential SSRF via alternative schemes.
- **Harden SSRF protection** - additional edge-case coverage for IPv6 and private-network ranges in `isPrivateIP` / `validateUrl`.
- **Login timing-safety** - timing-safe comparison now used across all login checks to prevent user-enumeration via response-time differences.
- **Standardize accessibility and focus states for global overlays** - keyboard focus is no longer lost or trapped unexpectedly in modal overlays.

### Features
- **Switch primary font to Questrial** - replaced Geologica with Questrial site-wide for a cleaner, more legible aesthetic.
- **Disable font synthesis** - prevent browsers from artificially bolding/italicising Questrial, preserving its intended rendering.
- **Auto-enable inspect mode** - opening a headful session for selector finding now automatically activates inspect mode, removing a manual step.
- **Optimize task cloning for versioning** - task clone operations are now significantly faster and produce leaner copies.
- **Larger page headings** - Dashboard, Run History, Settings, and Captures screen headings increased from `text-base` to `text-2xl`.

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix headful session and agent handoff** - a null browser reference caused headful sessions to fail silently; reference is now guarded correctly.
- **Fix inspect-mode click interception** - clicks in headful mode were being swallowed by the inspect overlay when it should not have been active.
- **Fix URL variable interpolation in headful mode** - variables resolving to objects were being coerced to `[object Object]` instead of their string value.
- **Fix headful modal sizing, context menu dismissal, and selector finder heuristics** - several UX regressions in the headful UI corrected in one pass.

### Improvements
- **Restyle screen headings** - page-level titles moved to minimal all-caps uppercase labels for a more refined look, now also larger.
- **Standardize accessibility roles** - `role`, `aria-*`, and focus-visible styles audited and normalised across ActionItem, tabs, and editor CTAs.
- **Remove unused `memo` import in ActionItem** - dead import and its wrapper removed; no behavioural change.
